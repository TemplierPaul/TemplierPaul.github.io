## Ingredients

### Almond Filling

* 140g almond flour
* 100g fine sugar
* 75g softened butter
* 2 eggs
* 50g toasted pine nuts

### Assembly & Pine Nut Crust

* 2 sheets of puff pastry
* 1 egg yolk (for glazing)
* 1 ceramic *fève* (a small ceramic bean)
* 50g pine nuts 

## Directions

### Preparation of the Filling

1. In a large bowl, combine the 140g of almond flour, 100g of sugar, 2 eggs, and 75g of softened butter.
2. Mix until the preparation is smooth and uniform.
3. Fold in the 50g of whole toasted pine nuts into the mixture to add internal texture.

### Assembly with Pine Nut Border

1. Place the first puff pastry sheet in a tart mold and prick it with a fork.
2. Spread the almond and pine nut filling onto the center of the dough, keeping 2cm of space from the edges.
3. Hide the *fève* within the filling.
4. Lightly dampen the outer edge of the bottom pastry with water. Sprinkle pine nuts along this damp border.
5. Cover with the second puff pastry sheet, pressing the edges firmly to seal the pine nuts between the two layers of dough in the crust.

### Finishing and Baking

1. Use the tip of a knife to score decorative patterns on the top lid.
2. Brush the entire surface with the egg yolk for a golden finish.
3. Place the remaining pine nuts on top of the galette following your scored design.
4. Bake in a preheated oven at **200°C** for **20 to 30 minutes**.
5. Check the baking regularly to ensure it does not over-brown.
