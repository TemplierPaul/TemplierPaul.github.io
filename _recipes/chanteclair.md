The [Chanteclair](https://patisserie-chanteclair.fr/fr/page/le-gateau-chanteclair) was created in the 1930's by M. Calvi, a pastry chef from Toulon, France. It takes its name from the ["Chantecler" play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chantecler_(play)) by Edmond Rostand, hence why it features a rooster on the top. While the official recipe is secret, I have spent countless holidays in Toulon as a kid and have then tried to recreate that childhood favorite at home.
This is my best attempt at it.

## Ingredients (~10 servings)

### Meringue Layers

* 128g egg whites (approx. 4 large eggs)
* 128g extra-fine granulated sugar
* 128g icing sugar (powdered sugar)

### Mocha Cream

* 1L heavy liquid cream (minimum 30% fat)
* 100g icing sugar (can be reduced for a less sweet profile)
* 16g coffee extract or very strong coffee. I use 4-5 tsp of Nescafé in a bit of hot water, then let it cool down.

### Decoration & Assembly

* 160g pralin or crushed hazelnuts
* Icing sugar (for dusting)
* 20cm [springform pan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springform_pan), a pastry ring, or a silicone mold

## Directions

### Meringue

1. Preheat your oven to 95°C.
2. Begin whipping the egg whites, gradually increasing the speed.
3. Once the whites start to firm up, add 1/3 of the fine sugar.
4. Continue whisking at high speed and incorporate the remaining 2/3 of the fine sugar until the meringue is stiff and glossy.
5. Stop the mixer and fold in the icing sugar in three stages (1/3 at a time) using a spatula.
6. Use a piping bag to create two circular disks. Pipe them almost to the edge of your 20cm mold dimensions, keeping them roughly 1.5cm thick. 
7. Bake for 2-3 hours. Periodically open the oven door slightly to allow moisture to escape. If piping extra thick layers, increase the baking time accordingly to ensure they are fully dried.

### Mocha Cream

1. Ensure the heavy cream is very cold before starting.
2. Whip the cream into a firm Chantilly.
3. Add the icing sugar and whisk briefly to incorporate.
4. Gently fold in the coffee extract or concentrated coffee until the color and flavor are uniform.

### Assembly

1. Put a sheet of parchment paper in the bottom of your mold to help with the removal.
2. Place the first meringue disk at the bottom of the ring. Chop the edges to make it fit, keeping 0.5cm between the meringue and the mould.
3. Spread half of the mocha cream over the meringue, smoothing it to the edges. Make sure it reaches the edges of the mold.
4. Place the second meringue disk on top, press it down gently to make sure it's well sealed with the first layer.
5. Cover with the remaining mocha cream and level the top. Again, make sure it reaches the edges of the mold around the meringue. 
6. Transfer to the freezer for several hours until completely set.
7. Once frozen, remove the ring. 
8. Decorate the top with the pralin/crushed hazelnuts and a final dusting of icing sugar. Use a rooster cutout to decorate with the traditional rooster on top.
9. Serve cold, but take it out of the freezer a few minutes before serving to let it soften slightly.
