This is my recipe for *lasagna al ragu*, the Italian pasta dish made with layers of pasta sheets, ragu, and bechamel sauce.
It is based on a traditional *sofrito* (mirepoix) and beef / pork ragu, but with smoked pork and a little cardamom for more depth and complexity. I also add a slurry of corn starch to thicken the ragu. Season the ragu and bechamel a bit stronger than you would normally, as the lasagna is baked for a long time.
Quantities are eyeballed for 1 large lasagna for 8+ people, adapt based on your taste. 

## Ingredients

### Ragu
- 1kg ground beef
- 200g smoked pork (pancetta or thick-cut smoked bacon)
- 3 medium onions
- 3 large carrots
- 3 celery branches
- 500g tomato puree or passata
- 150ml dry red wine
- 1 cardamom pod 
- 1-2 tablespoon of corn starch
- Rosemary
- Salt and pepper

### Bechamel
- 100g butter
- 100g flour
- 1.2L whole milk
- Nutmeg (to taste)
- 60g grated parmesan
- Salt and pepper

### Assembly
- Lasagna pasta sheets (no-boil or fresh)
- 100g grated parmesan (for topping)

## Directions

### Ragu
1. Finely dice the onions and celery to create a consistent mirepoix. Dice carrots into small cubes of 0.5cm to keep some texture.
2. Place the smoked pork in a cold, heavy-bottomed pot. Render the fat over medium heat until the white parts get translucent.
3. Add the diced onions, carrots, and celery to the rendered fat. Sauté until the vegetables soften.
4. Increase the heat slightly and add the ground beef. Cook until browned, breaking up large chunks.
5. Deglaze with red wine, scraping the bottom of the pot. Let it simmer until the alcohol scent dissipates.
6. Stir in the tomato puree.
7. Add the rosemary sprigs and the crushed cardamom pods. 
8. Make a slurry: in a glass, mix the corn starch with a little cold water. Pour the slurry into the pot while stirring.
9. Lower the heat and simmer for at least 45-60 minutes, up to 2-3h.

### Bechamel
1. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat.
2. Whisk in the flour and cook for 2 minutes without browning to remove the raw flour taste.
3. Add the milk, whisking constantly to ensure a smooth texture.
4. Once all milk is incorporated, continue to stir until the sauce gets thick.
5. Season with salt, pepper, and a generous amount of nutmeg.
6. Whisk in parmesan until melted, then remove from heat.

### Assembly
1. Spread a thin layer of bechamel on the bottom of a large baking dish (approx. 30x40cm).
2. Place a layer of pasta sheets over the sauce.
3. Layer approximately 1/2 of the ragu, followed by a layer of bechamel.
4. Repeat the pasta, ragu, and bechamel layers until ingredients are nearly exhausted.
5. For the final layer, place pasta sheets and cover entirely with the remaining bechamel (no ragu on top).
6. Sprinkle the 100g of parmesan evenly over the top.
7. Bake at 180°C for 40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the pasta is tender.
