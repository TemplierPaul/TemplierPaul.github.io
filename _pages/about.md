I am a French PhD student in Evolutionary machine learning at ISAE-SUPAERO in Toulouse, France. Welcome to my personal web page!

# Bio

I received a Masters in Engineering from ISAE-SUPAERO with a specialization in Machine Learning and robotics, and a Masters in Operations Research from the University of Toulouse in 2020. After a research internship on neuroevolution in the SuReLI group at ISAE-SUPAERO, I am currently working on my PhD in machine learning in the same lab, focusing on Evolution Strategies to train artificial neural networks for policy search.
