Personal website of Paul Templier, a French PhD student in Evolutionary machine learning at ISAE-SUPAERO, Toulouse, France.

# Bio

I received a Masters in Engineering from ISAE-SUPAERO with a specialization in Machine Learning and robotics, and a Masters in Operations Research from the University of Toulouse in 2020. After a research internship on neuroevolution in the SuReLI group at ISAE-SUPAERO, I am currently working on my PhD in machine learning in the same lab, focusing on bio-inspired algorithms to train artificial neural networks for reinforcement learning tasks.
