Hi there, I’m a French researcher and engineer working on adaptive control of robots and autonomous systems. Welcome to my personal web page!

My research is dedicated to understanding how intelligence emerges in complex systems. Currently a Postdoc at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) in [Prof. Antoine Cully's](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/antoine.cully) lab, I obtained my PhD studying the search for intelligent agents by mixing Evolution, Reinforcement Learning, and Quality-Diversity. 

My work ranges from theoretical contributions in evolutionary methods to practical applications in adaptive robotics, motivated by a single question: **how can we design learning processes that allow artificial agents to discover diverse, high-performing skills on their own**? 

I also love cooking, so you can find some of my personal recipes in the [Cooking](recipes/) section. Feel free to try them out and let me know if you like them!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
